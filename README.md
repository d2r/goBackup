goLocBackup is a program designed for two audiences. The first audience is a technically savvy user who wishes to backup their data. The second audience is for developers who wish to build upon the base that I have started.

What is this program designed to do?
This program was optimized to be used in a chron job. It can be used on the commandline as well, but I have optimized the program to be used with a preferences file.

What are its limitations?
The program is currently limited to 25MB of stored data. In the future, I plan to upgrade the capabilities of the program to split a file into multiple 25MB parts.

What do you need to run this program?
This program requires a cloudflare free or higher tier account. It is preferred, but not necessary to have a configured workerskv token created on the cloudflare website.

You need a computer (virtual is good as well) and some data that you need backed up.

How do you install the program?
You can acquire the source code from: https://github.com/israbhu/goBackup

Run "go build" in the directory.
